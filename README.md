# protein-ligand-docking
This repository contains a genetic algorithm for protein-ligand docking. It optimizes ligand positions based on proximity to active sites using evolution techniques. The code includes functions for initialization, fitness calculation, selection, crossover, and mutation. Test cases are provided to validate the algorithm's performance.
